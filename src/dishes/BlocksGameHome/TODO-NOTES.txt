- Inconsistencies accessing sub-managers (somewhere passed as props, somewhere read directly from gameManager global object)

- Fix select - no-pan issue.

- Fix types for useUIBinder. Conclude changes wrt comparator-optimisations.

- Introduce/accomotate/think about gameState, so certain things can be controlled based on it.

- Revamp BlockSet/Draggable components such that it can be enabled/disabled depending on gameState.

- Remove unwanted properties from entity data (ex: color)

- Make Managers/Entities have a UIBinder instead of extending to it:
    - new UIBinder() will be passed into Managers/Entities during instantiation
    - uiBinder.setLatestData() -uiBinder.setLatestDataAndNotify() etc
    - But infering types might get complicated (by infering, I mean return type of useBinder(...) should get auto detected 
    based on the instance passed in)
    
- Instead of all blocks having a same border color, add a separate border colors according to their colors

- Instead of marking only the overlaping cell as red, mark the whole preview as red

- Expand StatsManager to:
show msgs ("All clear!", "3 in a row!", "4 in a row!" etc) when needed
(curate the idea, check if to hand it over to a new Manager class)



- do not directly export instance of gameManager, instead use getInstance(...) on GameManager (for now singleton, 
but will be easy to extend). Make gameManager import/usage consistent according to this.

- UndoAbility to be done

- Add haptics/vibration on blockset tap and hold



---- DONE ----

- Add AbilityManager (manager) and Ability (base entity). With abilities like:- ColorClearAbility, UndoAbility etc
    - Check if it requires us to introduce a new folder, or works with manager-entity-ui architecture.

- make processDrop, processRemoveBlocks (now both combined), etc (gameboard processing methods) as async methods (this allows
them to handle their own delays in much easier way and produce a final result, lets say a score update, after
everything is done).

- Add StatsManager (holds stats data that even powers the activation of abilities) move score into it.

- Think of moving the drag/drop handlers to DropManager (P1) (create DragDropService instead, which isn't owned by gameManager)
    - Not doing it currently, because this introduces additional work/planning/approach of recreating/updating 
    worklets (to update selectedShape and cell) everytime any dependencies (occupancyMatrix, blockSize, boardAnimatedRef) changes.
    Currently, the worklets are created within component, and hence they're automatically recreated everytime any dependencies change.
    To avoid complexities initially, let's go ahead the way it is. Later this needs to be revamped wrt better architecture.

- Make notifyChange() async by using setTimeout/setImmediate (promise used), so let's say if multiple nofityChange() gets called in 
a synchronous block, only one final change gets triggered (P1)(see the impact/consequences)
